# Code of Conduct

Welcome to **the Encyclopedia of Metaframeworks** repository! This is a collaborative space dedicated to building a comprehensive encyclopedia of JavaScript metaframeworks and related resources. To ensure this remains a positive and productive environment for everyone, weâ€™ve established a few guidelines. Please take a moment to read them.

## Our Goal

This repository aims to be a **welcoming, inclusive, and respectful** community where developers of all backgrounds and skill levels can contribute, learn, and share knowledge about metaframeworks. Letâ€™s keep the focus on the code, the tools, and the ideasâ€”not on politics, personal opinions, or unnecessary conflict.

## Expected Behavior

We encourage all contributors to:

* **Be kind and respectful.** Treat others with empathy and understanding.
* **Focus on the topic.** Keep discussions and contributions relevant to metaframeworks and web development.
* **Be constructive.** Offer feedback and suggestions in a helpful and positive way.
* **Celebrate diversity.** Welcome people of all backgrounds, identities, and experiences.
* **Assume good intent.** If something seems off, ask for clarification before jumping to conclusions.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To maintain a healthy community, the following behaviors are not allowed:

* **Personal attacks, insults, or harassment.** This includes any form of discrimination or exclusionary language.
* **Political or off-topic debates.** This is a space for technical discussion, not unrelated arguments.
* **Spam or self-promotion.** Contributions should add value to the repository, not serve as advertising.
* **Disrespectful or dismissive comments.** Even if you disagree, keep it civil and constructive.

## Enforcement

If you encounter behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fyodorio/awesome-metaframeworks/issues) or contacting the maintainers directly. Weâ€™ll review the situation and take appropriate action, which may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the repository.

## Our Commitment

As maintainers, weâ€™re committed to fostering a **safe and inclusive** environment for everyone. Weâ€™ll do our best to address issues promptly and fairly, and weâ€™ll always strive to lead by example.

## Final Note

This repository is a labor of love, and weâ€™re thrilled to have you here. Letâ€™s work together to make it a valuable resource for the entire JavaScript community. Remember: **inclusivity and respect make everything better**.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
