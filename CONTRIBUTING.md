Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate
- Suggested _tools_ should be tested and documented
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
- Use the following format: `[Suggestion](link). Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- The pull request should have a meaningful title and include a link to the suggested resource and why it should be included
